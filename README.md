# CSE211s-Introduction-to-Embedded-Systems
### Descriiption
The goal of this project is to develop an embedded system using C programming that 
gathers real-time positional coordinates while a microcontroller is in motion (GPS tracking 
system using TM4C123G LaunchPad) after power-on until a destination point is reached. 
The collected data will then be efficiently transferred to a personal computer (PC) and 
visualized on a map application.
